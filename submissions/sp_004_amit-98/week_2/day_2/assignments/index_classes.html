                    Garfield is a fictional cat and the protagonist of the comic strip Garfield, 
                    created by Jim Davis.The comic strip centers on Garfield, portrayed as a lazy,
                     fat, and cynical orange cat. He is noted for his love of lasagna and sleeping
                     , and his hatred of Mondays, fellow cat Nermal and exercise.<br><br>

                    Garfield was born on June 19, 1978, in the Kitchen of Mamma Leoni's 
                    Italian Resturant. As a kitten,he developed a taste for lasagna, the 
                    owner of Mamma Leoni's had to choose between keeping Garfield was adopted 
                    from the store by Jon Arbuckle on June 19, 1978.In his cartoon appearances, 
                    Garfield usually causes mischief in every episode. In June 1983, comic strips 
                    introduced Amoeba Man , one of Garfield alter-egos, yet he was only shown in 
                    six stipes.<br><br>

                    Garfield frequently gets into many adventures, such as getting stuck in roll-up 
                    shades, sparring with mice, and getting locked up in animal shelters. In 2005, 
                    Garfield and Jon appeared in several comic strips of Blondie in honor of their 
                    75th anniversary.Garfield got excited because he didn't have to think.There was
                     an earlier Blondie crossover on the Garfield strip published April 1, 1997 and
                      versa, as part of the comic strip switcheroo.

                    Garfield is an overweight anthropomorphic orange tabby noted for his laziness, smug sarcasm, and intense passion 
                    for food, particularly lasagna, pizza, and ice cream. Throughout the course of the strip, Garfield's weight is often
                     an object of ridicule, particularly by his talking electronic scale. Garfield usually does not handle insults or 
                     commands from the scale very well, and will normally respond to such remarks with violence or a comeback of some type.<br><br>

                    Garfield lives with his slightly eccentric, socially awkward owner Jon Arbuckle and Jon's dimwitted pet dog Odie, and derives 
                    pleasure from satirically teasing their idiotic behavior. Garfield is not particularly fond of Odie (as obviously expected 
                    from the common hatred shared by cats and dogs) and enjoys causing him physical harm or insulting him, seldom showing empathy 
                    for the beagle. Albeit Odie shows Garfield no belligerence of any kind and would never deliberately cause him harm.<br><br>

                    Garfield dislikes him regardless and is apt to make rude comments based on the utter lack of intelligence displayed by Odie. 
                    However, Odie is not the only target of Garfield's torments; he frequently pokes fun at Jon as well for his nerdy behaviors 
                    and unpopularity with women, along with his tacky, ridiculous fashion sense. Despite this, Garfield cares for Odie and Jon 
                    regardless, but he especially shows affection for his beloved teddy bear Pooky, which is frequently seen in his arms or close to its owner

        <p>Masai School is a 21st-century career 
            focussed coding school. We are on a 
            mission to find untapped or underutilized 
            talent and to train them for the most in-
            demand jobs in the world. Masai School is 
            introducing a new model of higher education 
            in which the school invests in the students, 
            instead of the other way around.</p>

1st we have to create a separate file for fit log using the command ** git log > filename.txt

now for each queston can be solved by following commands

1. grep commit filename.txt | wc -l
2. grep Author filename.txt | uniq | wc -l
3. grep Author filename.txt | uniq-c | sort -n | tail -n 1
4. grep 2018 filename.txt | grep Jan filename.txt | wc -l
5. grep 2019 filename.txt | grep Sep filename.txt | wc -l

    <p id="font1">The word book comes from Old English "bōc", which in turn comes from the Germanic root "*bōk-", cognate to "beech". Similarly, in Slavic languages(for example, Russian, Bulgarian,
        Macedonian) "буква" (bukva--"letter") is cognate with "beech". In Russian and Serbian and Macedonian, the "букварь" (bukvar') or "буквар" (bukvar) refer specifically to a primary
        school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing. It is thus conjectured that the earliest Indo-European writing may have been carved on beech wood
        Similarly, the Latin word codex, Meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant "block of wood".

    <p id="font1">Antiquity</p>
    <p id="font2">Tablet</p>
    <p id="font3">A tablet is a physically robust writing medium, suitable for casual transport and writing. Clay tablets were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily 
        carried, and impressed with a stylus. They were used as a writing medium, especially for writing in cuneiform, throughout the Bronze Age and well into the Iron Age. Wax tablets 
        were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus. They were the normal writing material in schools, in accounting, and for taking 
        notes. They had the advantage of being reusable: the wax could be melted, and reformed into a blank.</p>
    <p id="font2">Scroll</p>
    <p id="font3">Scrolls can be made from papyrus, a thick paper-like material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant, then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool until 
        it is flattened. Papyrus was used for writing in Ancient Egypt, perhaps as early as the First Dynasty, although the first evidence is from the account books of King Nefertiti Kakai 
        of the Fifth Dynasty (about 2400 BC). Papyrus sheets were glued together to form a scroll. Tree bark such as lime and other materials were also used.
        According to Herodotus (History 5:58), the Phoenicians brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century BC. The Greek word for papyrus as writing material (biblion) 
        and book (biblos) come from the Phoenician port town Byblos, through which papyrus was exported to Greece. From Greek we also derive the word tome (Greek: τόμος), which originally 
        meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote "a roll of papyrus". Tomus was used by the Latins with exactly the same meaning as volumen (see also below the explanation by 
        Isidore of Seville).
        Whether made from papyrus, parchment, or paper, scrolls were the dominant form of book in the Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese, Hebrew, and Macedonian cultures. The more modern codex book 
        format form took over the Roman world by late antiquity, but the scroll format persisted much longer in Asia. </p>
    <p id="font2">Codex</p>
    <p id="font3">A codex (in modern usage) is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a "book": leaves of uniform size bound in some manner along one edge, and 
        typically held between two covers made of some more robust material. The first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from Martial, in his Apophoreta CLXXXIV at the end of 
        the first century, where he praises its compactness. This change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are 
        several: the format is more economical, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it is portable, searchable, and easy to conceal. A book is much easier to read, to find 
        a page that you want, and to flip through. A scroll is more awkward to use.  In addition, some metal books were made, that required smaller pages of metal, instead of an impossibly 
        long, unbending scroll of metal. A book can also be easily stored in more compact places, or side by side in a tight library or shelf space.</p>
    <p id="font2">Manuscripts</p>
    <p id="font3">The fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD saw the decline of the culture of ancient Rome. Papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with Egypt, and 
        parchment, which had been used for centuries, became the main writing material. Parchment is a material made from processed animal skin and used—mainly in the past—for writing on. 
        Parchment is most commonly made of calfskin, sheepskin, or goatskin. It was historically used for writing documents, notes, or the pages of a book. Parchment is limed, scraped and 
        dried under tension. It is not tanned, and is thus different from leather. This makes it more suitable for writing on, but leaves it very reactive to changes in relative humidity and 
        makes it revert to rawhide if overly wet. Monasteries carried on the Latin writing tradition in the Western Roman Empire. Cassiodorus, in the monastery of Vivarium (established 
        around 540), stressed the importance of copying texts. St. Benedict of Nursia, in his Rule of Saint Benedict (completed around the middle of the 6th century) later also promoted 
        reading. The Rule of Saint Benedict (Ch. XLVIII), which set aside certain times for reading, greatly influenced the monastic culture of the Middle Ages and is one of the reasons 
        why the clergy were the predominant readers of books. The tradition and style of the Roman Empire still dominated, but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged. Before the 
        invention and adoption of the printing press, almost all books were copied by hand, which made books expensive and comparatively rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen 
        books, medium-sized perhaps a few hundred. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in Avignon and Paris 
        library of the Sorbonne held only around 2,000 volumes.
        The scriptorium of the monastery was usually located over the chapter house. Artificial light was forbidden for fear it may damage the manuscripts. There were five types of scribes:
        
           1. Calligraphers, who dealt in fine book production
           2. Copyists, who dealt with basic production and correspondence
           3. Correctors, who collated and compared a finished book with the manuscript from which it had been produced
           4. Illuminators, who painted illustrations
           5. Rubricators, who painted in the red letters

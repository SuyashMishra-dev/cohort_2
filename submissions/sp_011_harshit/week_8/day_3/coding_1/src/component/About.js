                Life-Changing Habits You Can Form in 66 Days
    
    
    RResearch shows that it takes, on average, 66 days to form a new habit. In my experience, though, the number isn’t the most important part — you can try to do something for 66 days or 6,000, but you’ll never make a change if you don’t have a good reason. What drives change? Pain. At some point, you simply can’t stand your current behavior or situation, and you need to do something about it.
    
    Over the years, I’ve found myself in this position multiple times. The habits I adopted as a result may seem like small improvements, with insignificant daily returns. But because I understand the pain I’d be in without them, these habits have changed my life. They might just change yours, too.
    1. Set three or four daily priorities
    
    This is one of the best productivity strategies there is. Focus is what leads to results. It’s the thing that will bring you closer to achieving your short- and long-term goals. But how do you focus when your days are filled with endless distractions? By limiting your options. Each morning, be clear with yourself about what you want to achieve. Then commit to completing three or four small, but essential, tasks — anything beyond is a bonus.
    2. Read for an hour a day
    
    I get it, you’re too busy to read. Or maybe you don’t like to read. Well, you’re not getting off that easily. Reading turns you into a better thinker and writer. If you do it every day, you’ll eventually stop hating it, and one day you’ll even love it.
    3. Get 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night
    
    I never sacrifice my sleep for anything. Yes, I said anything. I recently canceled a meeting because I went to bed too late the night before. I had been reading a good book that completely consumed me, and started taking notes on that book. Before I knew it, it was 2 a.m. I was supposed to wake up at 7 a.m. to make the meeting.
    
    So I canceled. This one meeting wasn’t worth being tired the whole day. While some people say they can perform well on five hours of sleep, those people are probably wrong. Protect your sleep, and be dead serious about it, whether that means going to bed early or adjusting your schedule.
    4. Walk 30 minutes a day
    
    If you can’t make time for a short daily walk, you’re not in control of your life. Walking, of course, keeps your body moving and is good for you, but the reason I love talking a walk is that it breaks up the mundane pattern of the day. Life is routine — there’s nothing wrong with that. But when you walk outside, you’re forced to be one with the world. Your senses are heightened. Your lungs feel the air, and your feet feel the texture of the ground. Go alone or with someone else — either way, get out, and enjoy your surroundings.
    5. Do regular full-body workouts
    
    Strength training has several benefits. It protects your bones, increases your muscle mass, keeps you lean, boosts your energy levels, and prevents injuries. I’ve been lifting weights since I was 16. I started with split routines, meaning I would work different muscles during every session. It turns out that muscles need more stress to become stronger. Ideally, you want to train all your muscles, three times a week. Full-body workouts are simple, practical, and they work.
